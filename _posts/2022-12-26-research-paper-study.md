The goal of this game is to move the Bullet next to the Target with the LEAST MOVEMENT of the Bullet.

- The target of each game is selected randomly.
- The different colored Bullets are placed randomly. Only Bullets can be moved throughout the game. The Bulletâ€™s direction can only be changed when it encounters the wall, bullet, or a target.
- The Bullet that has to reach the target should match the color with the Target.

### Example

1. First, see the selected target (red hexagon) in the middle of the box and locate the red hexagon and the matching colored bullet (red) from the box.

### How to adjust the difficulty level?

Since the game gets harder if the game box gets bigger, the difficulty level can be adjusted with the size of the game box. The levels can be divided into easy, medium, and hard with easy having the smallest box and  hard having the biggest box. The number of the bullets, walls, and targets should also be adjusted since there will be less space for the easy level.

### How does it help with Dementia?

- Increase analytical intelligence by thinking about the next action to reach a bullet to the target.
- It helps with space intelligence by moving the bullets in different directions.
- Thinking about several steps and ways to finish the game will help with memory.
